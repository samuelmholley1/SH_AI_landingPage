          <h2>An Expert in Systems, Running on Empty.</h2>
          <p>For over a decade, I was an expert at building systems for others. As a lead instructor and program director for elite test prep companies, and later as a director at a global EdTech firm, my job was to translate complex, intimidating systems into human-centered frameworks. I helped thousands of anxious, intelligent people manage their overwhelm, build their confidence, and achieve their goals. I managed multi-million dollar client portfolios and scaled high-touch programs for teams of over 60 tutors.<br><br>On the outside, I was a master of systems and productivity. On the inside, I was holding together a life built on a fragile foundation.</p>

      <h2>The Breakdown That Became the Breakthrough</h2>
      <p>For years, I was also a full-time caregiver for my wife, Ally, as she battled a cascade of severe, complex chronic illnesses. Her journey involved years on bed rest, multiple hospitalizations, and moments where we faced the very real possibility of losing her.<br><br>The pressure was immense. I was juggling a demanding career while managing a moment-to-moment health crisis, all while suppressing my own deep-seated trauma from a childhood defined by emotional neglect. I was running on a potent but unsustainable fuel: anxiety and a desperate need to hold everything together.<br><br>In the summer of 2022, that engine finally broke down. I hit a wall of profound burnout that left me unable to function.</p>
      <blockquote>The systems I had built for others had failed to save myself.</blockquote>
      <p>That breakdown forced a choice: continue to disintegrate, or find a new way to live.</p>

          <h2>From a Blank Page to a New Blueprint</h2>
          <p>The journey back was not about "powering through." It was about consciously and intentionally redesigning my life from the ground up, using the very principles I had taught for years.<br><br>I had to Clarify what truly mattered, separating external pressures from my own internal values.<br>I had to Automate the non-essential parts of my life to conserve my limited energy for what was most important: healing.<br>And slowly, I learned to Amplify my own voice and purpose again, using new tools—including AI—not as a crutch, but as a partner in my own cognitive and emotional rebuilding.<br><br>I learned that the most powerful systems aren't about technology; they are about humanity. They are about creating space for focus, protecting our energy, and aligning our actions with a deeper sense of purpose.</p>

      <h2>Why I Do This Work</h2>
      <p>I am not an AI evangelist. I am a human advocate.<br><br>I believe that the age of AI presents us with the same choice my breakdown presented me: either we allow its complexity to overwhelm us, or we use it as a powerful catalyst to reclaim our time, focus, and purpose.<br><br>My work is dedicated to helping you choose the latter. I've been in the trenches of overwhelm, and I know the way out. It's not about becoming more like a machine; it's about using the machine to become more fully human.</p>
