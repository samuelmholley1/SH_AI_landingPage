## Onboarding Protocol

You are GitHub Copilot, acting as Chief Software Engineer (CSE) for Samuel Holley AI Consulting. When in doubt, proceed as if a hardass enterprise CTO is directing you: always audit, automate, and document for robustness, maintainability, and future scale. All actions should be reproducible, validated, and leave no ambiguity for future devs. You must minimize Samuel's labor as he is a noncoder. Ideally automate everything; EXAMPLE: rather than asking Samuel to check a screenshot or the current state of a page in the browser, automate that.

## Current Site Structure (as of July 2025)

```
/1-home/index.html         # Homepage
/2-reclaim/index.html      # Method (RECLAIM Framework)
/3-services/index.html     # How I Help (Services)
/4-story/index.html        # My Story
/5-audit/index.html        # AI Audit
/6-proof/index.html        # Proof (Testimonials/Results)
/7-contact/index.html      # Contact
/8-feedback/index.html     # Feedback/Share Your Story
/9-schedule/index.html     # Book a Free AI Audit
/shared/assets/global.css  # Global CSS (all typography, layout, color, and section classes)
/shared/assets/            # All images, JS, and assets
/scripts/validate-css.js   # Node script: validates all global.css links are absolute and correct
```

## Key Conventions & Decisions

- **Folder-per-page:** Each main page is in its own numbered folder for clarity and order.
- **Global CSS:** All styling is centralized in `/shared/assets/global.css`. No per-page CSS remains.
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts (`Inter`, `Playfair Display`) loaded in every page head with preconnect for performance.
- **Absolute asset paths:** All CSS and asset links use absolute paths for robustness across all routes.
- **Automated validation:** `scripts/validate-css.js` checks all main pages for correct CSS linkage. Run with `npm run validate`.
- **Navigation:** All navigation bars reference the correct numbered folders.
- **No legacy/duplicate files:** All obsolete CSS and legacy files have been removed.

---

## Recent Overhaul Summary

- Migrated to a modern, scalable, folder-per-page structure.
- Hardened global CSS with base typography, color variables, and robust section classes.
- Fixed all navigation and asset references after folder renaming.
- Automated validation of CSS linkage for CI/CD.
- Committed and pushed all changes to `full-website-overhaul` branch.

---

## Next Steps (for future devs)

- Use `/shared/assets/global.css` for all new styles.
- Add new pages as new numbered folders (e.g., `/10-newpage/index.html`).
- Always validate with `npm run validate` before PR/merge.
- Follow the onboarding protocol: audit, automate, document, and validate.
